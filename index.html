                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My Name is <em> Brian Kinyua</em>. I am a Kenyan citizen. I am born of two God-fearing parents. I was born in 2005 June. I've just finished high school studies. I was schooling at Kagumo High School, It is located in the central region.

                    During School holidays I used to help my father in his workshop. He taught me how to design using software such as ArtCam and produce the designs using a <abbr title="Computer Numeric Controlled">CNC</abbr> machine. I have a lot of experience in operating different types of power tools and of-course a  <abbr title="Computer Numeric Controlled">CNC</abbr> machine.

                <h2 class="">Why Direct-Ed</h2>
                <p>
                    Since I was a kid I had passion for computers. I was priviledged to have parents who owned laptops. I cannot even remember when I first used a laptop but I was pretty young. Since joining high school I developed even more passion and as a result I joined a computer class. It was in school where I learnt about Direct-Ed and I promised myself I would work hard and apply for enrollment in the program. I always wanted to learn how to code but I never knew how I'd learn until I heard about Direct-Ed. I also think my future is in the world of computers and engineering with no doubt.
